Emma: *ktztz* "Hello? Did you forget to say hi to Alexander from me?"
Alexander: "Emma, you have already said hi three times since when we got here"
Emma: *ktztz* "Wait, are you telling me I’m being annoying??"
John: "..."
Alexander: "No that’s not what I meant, what I meant is -"
Emma: *ktztz* "We’ll talk later, I have something to show John first."
Alexander: "... I’m in trouble."
Emma: *ktztz* "Darling, you were not expecting to wander around Mars on foot, right? 
Since you are going on an adventure, I have a gift for you. 
While you were working on the panels, I was also fixing and turning on Bertha..."
John: "...?"
Alexander: "Did you just gave a name to our Rover?"
Emma: *ktztz* "My… our “Rover” is like the fifth member of this Mission, so treat it with respect. 
Now dear, Bertha is waiting for you outside. She has an automated navigation system that will take you right where you need to go.
I’ll also monitor your position to make sure you get there and come back in one piece. 
She’s waiting for you."
Alexander: "Ok, so, don’t forget, I need Magnesium Sulfate, Iron Sulfate, and Opaline silicates.
They can all be found in the Valles Marineris."
Emma: *ktztz* "Position set! Time to go!"
Alexander: "Good luck my friend."
