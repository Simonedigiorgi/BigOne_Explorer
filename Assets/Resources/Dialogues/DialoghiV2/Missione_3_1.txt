Emma: "Mmmhp… Mmh…"

Marika: "Isn’t she cute while she sleeps?
Poor soul, always so hard working and mindful of everyone near her.
That’s no surprise her body couldn’t withstand everything, especially since she is so young.

Be mindful John, sticks and stones - well, in this case rocks - may break your bones,
but your mind is also susceptible to what surrounds you, and Mars is something no human has ever experienced.
That’s why I work in the infirmary, now she just needs to rest.
In the meantime, I have a task for you.
Here, take this."

"This is my camera, I don’t think I’ll have the time to use it, so I’m giving it to you."
John: "...?"
Marika: "Emma said to me that she finds satellite images of the Noctis Labyrinthus calming and relaxing.
She also said she likes the colors and shapes of minerals situated there.
I’m actually surprised she hasn’t spoken about it to you."
John: "..."
Marika: "I’m asking you to go there and take a good picture for her. This would really help her recovering, she will probably be thankful for it.
Can you do this?"
John: "...!"
Marika: "What would we do without you, John?
By now Alexander should have learnt how to set a position and monitor Bertha, so you should be able to make it to the Noctis Labyrinthus without any difficulty."
John: "..."
Marika: "I know how stressful this travelling and the lack of privacy can be, so if you need to talk about anything I’m always here to talk.
Now go to Bertha, I’ll contact Alexander for you."
