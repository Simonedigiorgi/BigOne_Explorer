Alexander: "Hello my friend! Looks like you are the chelovek of the day! You surely boosted our morale.
Now, it looks like your actions got the interest of the governments. They gave Mars Society the clearance to search for new places to build laboratories around the planet. They want us to check for suitable places first.
We are talking about caves, sheltered from most of the planet radiations.
Alexander hopes you are not afraid of dark places."
Marika: "Radiation, at its most basic, is simply waves or subatomic particles that transports energy to another entity.
Mars has no global magnetic field to deflect energetic particles and its atmosphere is much thinner than Earth’s.
There are two sources of radiation:
The first comes from the sun, which regularly releases a steady stream of solar particles.
The second comes come from galactic cosmic rays.
The effects on the human body can be an increased risk for cancer later in life or, at its worst, acute radiation sickness during the Mission if the dose of energetic particles is large enough."
John: "...!"
Alexander: "Now now, don’t worry my friend, your suit is designed to protect you from most of this.
I have already worked to look for a first suitable place, and you are going to like it because you have already been in that vicinity.
You’ll have to go back to the Valles Marineris.
Once you are there you’ll have to look for a cave entrance and check the radiation level inside.
That’s why I’m giving you my Geiger counter, I have another one to keep working here."
