Emma: "Our hero, you have no idea of the excitement back at Earth, when I told them of your discovery!
That data is surely going to be useful for the reconnaissance, and maybe one day for the colonization of planets and solar systems even further than Mars!"
John: "..."
Emma: "While you were coming home, I prepared another gift for you, darling!
It needs to be tested here on Mars, and I had to ask for clearance before being able to work on it.
See, I have noticed how much research potential we have lost since our arrival, due to the difficulty of reaching determined places, this should help you in your exploration.
Here, give it a try later on.”
